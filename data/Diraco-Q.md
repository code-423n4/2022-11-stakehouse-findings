The transfer() function only allows the recipient to use 2300 gas. If the recipient uses more than that, transfers will fail. In the future gas costs might change increasing the likelihood of that happening.

Keep in mind that call() introduces the risk of reentrancy. But, as long as the router follows the checks effects interactions pattern it should be fine. Itâ€™s not supposed to hold any tokens anyway.

Recommended Mitigation 
Replace transfer() calls with call() .
