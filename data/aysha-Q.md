External calls in loop can lead to denial of service: Several function calls are made in unbounded loops. This pattern is error-prone as it can trap the contracts due to the gas limitations or failed transactions.

Recommendation: Short term, review all the loops mentioned above and either: 1) allow iteration over part of the loop, or 2) remove elements. Long term, subscribe to Crytic.io to review external calls in loops. Crytic catches bugs of this type.
