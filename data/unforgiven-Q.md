[[1]] Function `withdrawETH()` in `GiantPoolBase` don't allow users to withdraw amount less than `MIN_STAKING_AMOUNT` which can cause users dust balance to stuck in contract. for example if user deposit `0.002` ETH and then withdraw `0.0015` he would have `0.0005` balance and because `MIN_STAKING_AMOUNT` is equal to `0.001` he wouldn't be able to withdraw that amount. so most of the users can't withdraw their small remaining amounts and they need to deposit some ETH then withdraw all of it. This limit is in other withdraw or rotate functions too which would cause the same problem(like `rotateLPTokens()` and `burnLPToken()` and `burnLPForETH()`)

[[2]] function `batchDepositETHForStaking()` in `GiantMevAndFeesPool` don't check for `_ETHTransactionAmounts` array length to be equal to other function argument arrays. other functions with multiple list in arguments check that all the list's length in the function arguments are equal.
